                    &nbsp After months and months of renovations, City Hall is now complete! The newly redone entry way and the magnificent new Hall of Fame will be opened to the public this weekend. <br><br>

                    &nbsp Last September, the officials at City Hall decided that the stained carpet and peeling wallpaper did not create a welcoming environment for community members as they entered City Hall. They brought their plan of action to city council and their project was approved! Community members also voted on an initiative to recognize individuals who have made large contributions to our lovely city. The first part of that initiative was to create a space of celebration and recognition. Members of the council came to an agreement that combining the recognition initiative and the City Hall renovations would be perfect.<br><br>

                    &nbsp After all the hard work of the planners, the construction crew, and the recognition committee, a beautiful, welcoming entry way has been constructed that features a tribute to involved and influential community members. <br> <br>
                    
                    &nbsp This Saturday, City Hall will be on display and the entire community is welcome to come enjoy the new areas. Food and live entertainment will be provided. <br><br>
