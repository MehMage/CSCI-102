                <div id="text">
                    Last year a bunch of german bakers got very worked up about an increase in pretzel taxes a large contributer to their economy, one baker went so far as to suggest this could lower national gdp due to lower consumption of pretzel products as a whole. Other protesters simply were concerned about the increase in the size of the government in general regardless of what is being taxexd they were just happy to be out on the weekend yelling about taxes<br><br>

                    An economist believes that the protesters are wrong sighted that the economy will be able to handle the increased growth of the pretzel realted sector and that rather than a slump in production there will actually be an increase in what some might call the overall general econnomy. pretzels for example are often seen as a consumer good but some have said due to their cultural importance they are worthy of protection from the whims of the wild market. still others believe that all of this is overblown pretzels will still be around they will simply habve to share in their ludicrious profits rather then simply sock away thousands of dollars in profits in the hope of influencing the notoriously competitive bacarian area parliment races and what do others still regard this as acocalytic. it is the beginnign of the end as some have said.<br><br>
                
                    Chancellor Merkel an avid pretzel consumer herself has even piped in on the drama related to the pretzel tax. she has stated opinions both for and against the tax despite the fact that is is a whoolly local policy intervention she believes that it may be misguided and has said that rather than taxing them the city should encourage more people to get involved in the casceant sectors of the econonmy instead of hiding in their parents basement and eating pretzels all day try and get out and actually do something. local leadership has said that while they agree with aspects of the chancellors ageenda they feel is short sighted and ignores the underlying reality of the pretzel economy in particular the fact that many pretzel consumers simply dont care about their price.
