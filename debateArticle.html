Things got heated after several candidates used personal attacks to go after their opponents. Discussing many topics from taxation to policymaking. The politicians attempt to curry the favor of the local populace. The main point of discussion revolved around what to do about the mysterious Banksy sculpture that appeared. While some suggested destroying it, a certain mysterious dark horse candidate supported worshiping the sculpture. With tensions high they discussed options to help the homeless population as well as ways to solve the housing crisis.    <br><br>
