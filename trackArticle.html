                    This Weekend 40 years ago rodney 'the danger' set the whatcom county record in the high jump, long jump, triple jump, 100m dash, 200m dash, 400m dash, 800m dash, 1600m dash, 100m hurdles, pole vault, javelin, discus, hammer throw and aerobic swimming. now how was it that one young man was able to do all this? its simple really he drugged all of his competition so they didnt show up to the event. while at the time whatcom sherrif's office whos dad was the boss of indicated it was a conincidence that 40 athletes all reported falling asleep for the same period of time some people suspected something was amiss. <br><br>

                    Rodney was always regarded as a feisty young fellow he first got in trouble at age 8 for quietly slipping his sister some nyquil so he would beat her in connect four. this no holds barred attitude towards poisioning his compeittiton never left rodney. he would go on to become an icon of his high school beating every single competitor by default because he drugged them. eventually though the law caught up to him in that he was asked to study chemisty and would go on to found a prominent chemical company that would later become infamous in using its clout to convince doctors to prescribe their pills at an unprecendented rate even though the health benefits were negligible rodney still pushed on for greater and greater ideals always striving to do the best he possibly could even if it meant breadking some rules along the whatcom-county-washington <br><br>

                    Roney's last big game was an attempt to influence local sports medicine regulators into allowing his chemichal complany to test anabolic steriods on teen sports stars to see if they were really all that bad. in reality rodney was well aware of the ill effects of steroids he simply prefferred to make money at all costs so he derived a formula that would force people to be suggetsible to whatever he said used this on the regulators and like magic he was testing steriods on anyone he wanted to eventually leading to someone finally breaking his record setting track and field times from 40 years earlier.
