                    &nbsp Fish fly in the markets as Pike Place again attracts record breaking crowds to view the many attractions. Veteran fisherman and salmon chucker, Coho Fuga, expertly flings the fish over the awed heads of the tourists as they mill around. Long lines form as customers vie for the chance to try local specialties. The aromas of Le Panier, the French bakery draws a crowd as their French baguettes and croissants leave everyone satisfied. The Mee Sum pastry shop also attracts people like flies as their steamed BBQ pork buns are a must have for all. As busy as ever the Starbucks at Pike Place, draws coffee fanatics from around the world, as the global phenomenon had its humble roots right here in the market.  <br><br>

                    &nbspFor those seeking a refreshing dairy filled drink look no farther than Pink Place Market Creamery. This shop offers all things dairy from milk to eggs to everything in between. Chug a glass of the rawest milk in the world or just eat a basket of quail eggs. No one will judge you. For those that seek the spice in life head straight to Market Spice, where you can find all sorts of spices, teas and coffees. A feature of the market for almost 100 years Market Spice can bring a zest to your food and your life! <br>
